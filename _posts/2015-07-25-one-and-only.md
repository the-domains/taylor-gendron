I used to see onenever noticed manyshe was my allshe was my every engulfed by time and spaceeach sighteach wordeach pace

But then from the inside outeverything slipped awayin every way possiblein every which waya supernova of heatand then the great freezeI was in fact freeto do as I please

A dot became a linebecame a circle became a sphereand now there were moreand then it became clearI was pulled to oneI was driven to anyand while it drove me insaneat least there were plenty

What was once my everythingwas simply a momentI could chase them allor at choose to relentfail or succeedthey would finally be partof that which was oncecompletely torn apart

I could yearn for themwhile having nonefeeling empty and completeboth at onceand theyone at a timeor two or threewere all that I would ever need

Whether they expandor grow closer than everit mattered no longerin this piece of foreverfor alone there is longingtogether, belongingbut if you close your eyesyou would swear there was nothing
